# ChestShop Market Analysis Bot for Discord

## Description

This Discord bot specializes in parsing and analyzing market transaction logs from the ChestShop plugin used in Minecraft servers. It provides a comprehensive overview of market activities, enabling users in your Discord server to gain insights into the economic dynamics of the Minecraft world. The bot is an invaluable tool for server admins, players, and economists alike, offering a detailed look into player transactions, item pricing, and market trends.
In its current state, the bot is perfectly functioning, but the code is highly unoptimised. To address this, I'm planning a future comprehensive revision.

## Features

- **Market Trends Analysis**: Calculates median and average prices, along with the amounts of items sold.
- **Monthly Price Tracking**: Analyzes and reports on the monthly price variations of items within the game.
- **Tax Computations**: Determines the total taxes paid in specific time frames, based on transaction logs.
- **Player Transaction Insights**: Gathers and displays data about individual players' buying and selling activities.
- **Data Management & Pruning**: Facilitates the pruning of player data upon request, aiding in data management.
- **Interactive Discord Commands**: Engages users with various commands to fetch specific data related to the Minecraft market.
- **Pagination for Data Display**: Implements pagination for presenting extensive data lists within Discord.
